          <h3 class="subtitle"><u>Work History</u></h3>
          <p>I've worked many jobs over the years, from restaraunt industry, tech help, and event planning my main focus
            has always been customer service. Here are a few of my most memorable</p>
          <br>
          <br>
          <ol><b>Event Planner</b> - From planning, setup, to execution I have done hundreds of events over the years.</ol>
          <ol><b>Sous Chef</b> - Went to culinary school right after High School. After cooking for a couple years I
            transitioned into event planning while still cooking for smaller events.</ol>
          <ol><b>Restaraunt Manager</b> - Opened a restaraunt located in Vancouver, WA. Used tech background to also build and
            maintain all systems used by restaraunt.</ol>
